Stops media comment spamming by removing the ability to comment on attachments.

== Description ==

If you find your media file attachments are being targeted by spam comments then here is the solution for you.

Stop Media Comment Spamming removes the ability for visitors to comment on media attachments.  It does *not* remove commenting from any other part of your WordPress installation.

Visitors will still be able to comment on your posts and pages.

*Why would you need this plugin?*

WordPress natively allows comments to be left on any file in the Media Library.

Unfortunately spammers can target this and quickly leave horrible and unrelated comments on your site.

WordPress provides no way in Admin Dashboard to disable this feature.

Some of the spam seems to get through popular spam filtering plugins.

You still want to allow visitors to comments on your posts and pages.

If only there was a plugin that allowed you to stop visitors leaving comments on media files.

Ta da!  Here's one.
